Some fun little C++ console mini games I created for my C++ assessment

Gomoku
- Demonstrates the use of 2D arrays
- Get five in a row to beat your opponent!

Sort Shooter
- Demonstrates the use of Sorted Complex Data Types
- Shoot the numbers from either low to high or high to low

Beat the Guesser
- Demonstrates the use of Binary Search
- The one who guesses the correct number first wins the game!
